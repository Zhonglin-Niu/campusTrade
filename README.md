## Inspiration
 - Want to sell something? Doesn't know where to post your stuff? 
 - Facebook Market? NO!
 - What if Calvin offers a website to sell your items?
    - _**That sounds great! Let's do it.**_

## What it does
 - It offers you options to sell your products, such as textbooks, bags, all your electronics!
 - If you know something about 3D printing? You can also sell your inventions here!
 - Want to build a PC? Maybe you can find what you need here!
 - You'll need to sign in using your Calvin Email. **(@calvin.edu)**
 - Create and post your product.
 - Search for products you need.
 - Filter products using categories and tags.

## How we built it
 1. Use Python's Flask web framework to develop the website.
 2. ElementUI for component library.
 3. Used JSON as database.
 4. Python and Flask as back-end
 5. TypeScript and Vue for front-end

## Challenges we ran into

 - Creating animations for pictures.
 - Filtering the products.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What's next for Campus Trader
